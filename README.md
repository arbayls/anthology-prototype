## Project Description

"At ClearVoice we work with freelance writers and help them build portfolios of their work in order to get jobs in our marketplace.

Our capstone project idea is to build a tool that allows a freelancer to automatically discover their works from around the web.

The project should allow a person to input their name, connect social accounts (at least Twitter), and input a couple of the main websites they write on.

Once the social profile, name and site information has provided, the tool should use available APIs to find articles written by the freelancers. It would be preferable to be able to show at least a subset of discovered articles immediately, but it would be acceptable to have an e-mail notification once the information is ready.

The posts should be displayed in an attractive card style and the freelancer should be able to select the posts they would like to add to their portfolio. However, we do not expect this to be a full portfolio tool at this time.

As a bonus - if you discover other media by the author such as Instagram, YouTube, or other media it would be interesting to see that included."
